## INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS & TROUBLESHOOTING

1.	Either connect the Xbox 360 Controllers to the computer with USB cable or connect the Xbox 360 		Wireless Gaming Receiver dongle to the computer and sync the two Xbox 360 Controllers to the 		dongle. 

	Instructions for how to install Xbox 360 Controllers can be found at:
	
	https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/xbox-360/xbox-on-windows/accessories/xbox-controller-for-windows-setup

	The game might work with newer Xbox Controllers but has not been tested with them. Instructions for how to install newer Xbox Controllers can be found at:
	
	https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/controller/connect-a-wireless-controller

2.	The game needs .NET Framework 3.5 to run. If it is not already installed it can be downloaded
	from:
	
	https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=25150

3.	The game needs XNA Framework Redistributable 3.1 to run. If it is not already installed it can be
	downloaded from:
	
	https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15163

4. 	If your computer can not start the game after step 3 you might also need to install .Net Framework
	4.5.1. It can be downloaded from:
	
	https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net451

5. 	If your computer can not start the game after step 4 you might also need to install Microsoft XNA
	Framework Redistributable 4.0. It can be downloaded from:
	
	https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914

6. 	If your computer still can't start the game it might be because your computer does not have
	Windows Media Player installed since Microsoft XNA share DLL files with it for some reason that I'm sure makes perfect sense in some Excel-file somewhere over at Microsoft.

## HOW TO PLAY TRANSMODALIS - HAPTIC WITH THE XBOX 360 CONTROLLRS

Transmodalis - Haptic uses two Xbox 360 Controllers per player because of the limited resolution of the controllers' vibrotactile (rumble) engines.

Player One uses Controller 1 as a regular controller, and Controller 2 as an additional controller for additional vibrotactile (rumble) output.  

Player Two uses Controller 3 as a regular controller, and Controller 4 as an additional controller for additional vibrotactile (rumble) output.

A suggestion is to either rest the additional controller in your lap or to carefully rest your feet, without shoes on, on top of it. 

If you are wearing pants made from a thicker fabric like jeans it might be difficult to feel the vibrotactile (rumble) interface signals through the fabric.

If you try to keep a bit of distance between the two controllers it might be easier to tell their vibrotactile (rumble) signals apart.
